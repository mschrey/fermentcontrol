# fermentcontrol
Control (or at least log) fermentation of beer using a Raspberry Pi, 1Wire temperature sensors and Remote Controlled outlets

this initial commit does not offer any flexibility with regard to 
* which or how many temperature sensor are needed to be read
* which code is needed to control the RC outlet
* set temperature is hard-coded
* interval at which is program is executed

so it probably will not be of any use for anybody until I get around to implementing a lot of flexibility for it...
